My journal of animations I liked, built, or felt inspired to recreate. Small motion experiments influenced by things I’ve seen, explored, or wanted to try. A casual place to collect ideas without a specific use case.

### 1. Typing Reveal

I don’t remember where I first saw this animation, but I liked it enough to recreate it back in 2021 on my first web development company’s landing page. I copied it from my old repo, so this is exactly how it looked back then.
